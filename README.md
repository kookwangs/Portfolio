# Portfolio
This repository presents my information, skills, and projects while tracking my progress as a recent **Computer Engineering** graduate pursuing a career as a **Database Engineer**.


## About me
**Based:** Nonthaburi, Thailand <br>
**Current Role:** Aspiring Database Engineer, Data Enthusiast <br>
**Email:** kunanya.khu@gmail.com <br>
**LinkedIn:** www.linkedin.com/in/kunanya-khuntiptong <br>


Hello! I'm Kunanya Khuntiptong, a recent Computer Engineering graduate passionate about data and its potential to solve complex problems. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve built a strong foundation in software development, systems engineering, and data management. With a special interest in database technologies, I’m currently **pursuing a career in Database Engineering**, where I can use my technical skills and problem-solving abilities to create efficient data solutions.


During my time at KMUTT, I explored various fields, including web development, AI, and data science. However, I found myself most drawn to the data field. Writing SQL felt both fun and challenging, especially when working with large datasets and uncovering meaningful insights. I enjoyed designing database structures for different projects and requirements, and working with both relational and NoSQL databases. Through hands-on experience in course projects, I discovered how much I liked solving data-related problems and helping others with database design.


I understand that real-world projects are much more complex than coursework, with many challenges beyond what I’ve learned. That’s why I’m eager to dive deeper, gain hands-on experience, and continue learning in a professional setting.
